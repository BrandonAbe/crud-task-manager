# crud-task-manager
CRUD app using Python backend, PostgreSQL, and Vanilla JS fetch API for HTTP calls

# Project Flow
How the flow works:
- Frontend displays task list and forms.
- User interacts with UI to create/edit/delete tasks.
- Frontend sends HTTP requests (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to backend API.
- Backend processes requests, interacts with PostgreSQL to read/write data.
- Backend sends JSON responses.
- Frontend updates the UI accordingly.

# Stretch goals (after MVP):
- Add user accounts and task ownership.
- Add drag-and-drop for task prioritization.
- Add notifications/reminders.
- Add task categories or tags.
- Deploy app on Heroku, Railway, or similar.
